## Creating A Custom Post Type Using Code
In the previous class we looked at creating custom post types from scratch using code. The WordPress register_post_type() method was central to creating the custom movies post type. Here is a quick overview of the code. We were able to change the icons the where the custom post type was displayed in the dashboard and and and remove elements that make up the post panel.

```php
//function creates a custom post type of movies
function create_post_type_movies()
{
    // creates label names for the post type in the dashboard the post panel and in the toolbar.
    $labels = array(
               'name' => __('Movies'),
               'singular_name' => __('Movie'),
               'add_new' => 'New Movie',
               'add_new_item'=> 'Add New Movie',
               'edit_item' => 'Edit Movie',

    );
    // creates the post functionality that you want for a full listing see the link attached above
    $args = array(
        'labels' => $labels,
        'public' => true,
        'has_archive' => true,
        'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'movies'),
         'menu_position' => 5,
         'menu_icon' => 'dashicons-admin-media',
         'supports'=> array('title', 'editor', 'custom-fields'
    );

   register_post_type('movies', $args  );
}
// Hooking up our function to theme setup
add_action('init', 'create_post_type_movies');

```

We also turned the Gutenberg post editor off in the functions.php file. The current functions.php file still has this line of code in it.

```php
  add_filter('use_block_editor_for_post', '__return_false', 10);

```

## Custom Post Type Using Plugins
By far the easiest quickest and simplest method to create custom post types is with plugins. We saw that register_post_type() has a whole lot of properties we can set. Likewise so will the plugins. We also used the custom field option in the post editor to add a specific piece of content to the custom post. You should have some familuarity with the options of these plugins.

Start by installing the following plugins
1. Custom Post Type UI
1. Advanced Custom Fields
1. Dashicons + Custom Post Types

Make sure and activate all of these plugins. We will create a Features Custom Post Type.
1. Open the style.css and increment the version number of the file and give it a description.
1. Create a template file for our features called single-features.php.
1. Upload your new template file to your themes directory.
1. Located in the dashboard sidebar at the bottom you will see an icon with squares named CPT UI.
1. Click on the add/edit post types.
1. Fill out the options that you wish your custom post type to have.
1. If you installed dash-icons you can use that to add a custom icon to your post type.
1. You can also easily create your own icon using this plugin.
1. Save the custom post type and create a new feature.
1. You should see your single-features.php file showing up.
1. Now lets add code to single.php to get it to display the title and the content.


```php

<?php get_header() ?>

<main id="main" class="site-main" role="main">
	<article id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" class="card">
	
		<?php while ( have_posts() ) : the_post();?>
		<div class="post-container">
		    <header class="post-header">
				<h2 class="post-title"><?php echo the_title(); ?><h2>
			</header>
			<div class="post-content">
				<?php  echo the_content(); ?>
			</div>
		</div>



		<footer class="post-footer">
			<h3>partial</h3>
			<p>generated by: single-features.php</p>
			<p>template location: <span class="attention">single-features.php</span></p>
		</footer>

	</article>
	<?php endwhile; ?>
	
</main>

<?php get_footer(); ?>

```
